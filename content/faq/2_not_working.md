The most likely cause is that your install is outdated. Check if there's any updates. You can either do so using our inbuilt updater, or if you cannot get there due to crashes or similar, use the "Update Vencord" in the Installer.

If you're all up to date, try reinstalling with the installer anyway!

And if it now still doesn't work, please let us know in our [support server](/discord)
