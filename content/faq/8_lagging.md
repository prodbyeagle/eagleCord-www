The most common cause of lag is poorly written CSS.

To see if this is the case for you, try temporarily disabling all themes and your QuickCSS.

If that indeed fixes the lagging, you'll have to figure out which theme / part of your QuickCSS is causing the lag.
Just slowly remove parts of it until it doesn't lag anymore.
