Technically yes, we have a very barebones app for android: [Vendroid](<https://github.com/Vencord/Vendroid>)
However, it suffers from many issues and thus is not recommended for daily use (nor is it actively being worked on)

Instead, we recommend the following alternatives:
- [Pyoncord](<https://github.com/pyoncord/Pyoncord>) ([discord server](<https://discord.gg/XjYgWXHb9Q>)) ~ supports both android & ios. uses the latest discord mobile app
- [Aliucord](<https://aliucord.com>) ([discord server](<https://discord.gg/EsNDvBaHVU>)) ~ android only. uses the old (now ~2 years old) version of the discord android app
