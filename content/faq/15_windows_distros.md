title: Does Vencord support a Windows Distro (e.g., AtlasOS, Tiny11)?

No, custom distributions of Windows are not supported as they tend to remove critical system components or libraries that Vencord (or its installer) depends on.

If it works for you, great! However, we can't provide support for any issues that occur.
